URL redirection, sometimes called HTTP redirection, is the process of pointing one URL to another one.

The Apache mod_rewrite module transforms incoming URL requests to a path in the web server's file system.

 Apache URL rewriting is based on pattern matching rules created using regular expressions.

 To restrict which users can view a password protected directory, use the Require directive with the value valid-user.

 A RewriteRule consists of three arguments separated by spaces: the incoming URL pattern, the susbstitue URL and flags.
