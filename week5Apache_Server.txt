Acting as a intermediary between the client and application services, a proxy server directs 
client requests to the appropriate backend server.


To view a list of all the currently running Docker containers, issue the command: docker container ls.


 To enable a module in the httpd.conf file, use the LoadModule Apache directive.


 A proxy server is typically used to distribute the load among several servers, seamlessly show content 
from different websites, or pass requests for processing to application servers over protocols other than HTTP.

To configure apache as a reverse proxy server you need to use both ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives 
in your configuration file.
